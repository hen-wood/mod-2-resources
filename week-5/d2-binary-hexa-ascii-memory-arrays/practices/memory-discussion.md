# Official answer:
Memory stores values of everything in a program using memory addresses. Memory addresses index 'words' which are made up of bits. Bits have an on or off state (binary). The number of bits in each word is dependent on the size of the processor (8-bit, 64-bit, etc.).

Binary code stored in each word is interpretted to whatever data type it represents by the processor.
